    "The DA scores are human evaluation scores such that given a **source** (`src`) sentence from one source language and a target **reference** (`ref`) from a distinct target language, the annotator evaluates how good the **hypothesis** (`mt`), or, in other words, the prediction of the machine translation system is. Such scores are typically calculated by several metrics and then aggregated with weighing (also called Multidimensional Quality Metrics - MQM) or they can be raw scores on a given scale which are then normalized across annotators. The DA score in the dataset we will evaluate was collected in the latter way.\n",

    "    You have already seen **BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy)** in Part 1 of this exercise session. BLEU score measures the similarity between the gold reference and the generated candidate. 100 means they are a perfect match, and 0 means some of the n-gram precisions do not get fulfilled. Note that this range may change to 1.0 to 0.0 depending on the implementation. such as the huggingface `evaluate` one:\n",

Read the first three paragraphs in Section 3 -- called \"Token representation\", \"Similarity Measure\", and \"BERTScore\" -- in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09675.pdf) and give a technical description of how the BERTScore precision/recall/f1 is calculated. You do not need to describe anything outside the scope of these specific paragraphs.**\n",

    "\n",
    "BERTScore computes a similarity score for tokens in the candidate and tokens in the reference, where tokens are tokenized using a BERT-family model. However, instead of exact matches like BLEU, they compute a soft token cosine similarity value using the respective BERT-family model's contextual embeddings. The soft-matching only counts the similarity of the most similar token in the reference or candidate, depending on whether it's a precision or recall measurement.\n",
    "- **bertscore-precision:**  Matches each token in the tokenized reference $\\tilde{x}$ to a token in the tokenized candidate $x$ to compute precision. Then divides by the length of the reference.\n",
    "- **bertscore-recall:** Matches each token in the tokenized candidate $x$ to a token in the tokenized reference $\\tilde{x}$ to compute recall. Then divides by the length of the candidate.\n",
    "- **bertscore-f1:** Calculates an F-1 score given the two prior measurements.\n",

    "*Your answer here*\n",
    "\n",
    "The translation ranking model is trained with \"better\" and \"worse\" hypothesis examples. Once the representation for both of these are extracted through pooling such as a CLS token, as well as for the source inputs, then a triplet margin loss is used to train the model in learning the ranking. In particular the model learns to associate the \"better\" hypothesis closer to the \"source\"' representation.\n",

    "- Now, we will calculate how much these scores correlate with human judgements using the `evaluate_metrics` function in `mt_eval.py`. \n",
    "- We will calculate [Kendall's tau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient) which requires ordinal, or in other words, ranked associations between data. One way we can turn the DA scores into ranks is to consider the human scores for various hypothesis of the same **source** and **language pair** as defining such ranks. For that we will create (worst_hypothesis, better_hypothesis) pair combinations. After getting the data we will calculate the correlation between the human scores and the metric scores and save it in `part2_corr.json`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q3: Given your understanding of BLEU, BERTScore and COMET, how would you interpret the Kendall's Tau correlation results? Which ones are the least and most correlated? What is your hypothesis regarding the reasons behind the lowest correlation for one metric and the highest correlation in the other?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your answer here*\n",
    "\n",
    "BLEU has the lowest correlation as it relies on surface-level n-gram overlap and ignores semantics. BERTScore performs better by using contextual embeddings but isn’t trained on human judgments. COMET combines both contextual understanding and supervision from human annotations, leading to the highest correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: Assume you have a large set of story beginnings and you would like to evaluate how well a model completes the stories. What problem would you run into with BLEU and COMET? Would the same disadvantages apply to BERTScore and why? Give your justification.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your answer here*\n",
    "\n",
    "BLEU and COMET would fail because they are too anchored in being similar to the reference. BERTScore would probably be more \"optimistic\" and give a higher score to a reasonable generation as it is untrained and computes a soft token cosine similarity rather than an exact one.\n"
